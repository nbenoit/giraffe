	Giraffe release 1.0

These are the release notes for giraffe version 1.0
Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about.


WHAT IS GIRAFFE ?

 GIRAFFE is a very simple logic circuit simulator. It consists of a
 circuit editor and a chronogram viewer. This program has been written
 for personnal use, so  don't blame me if you think I am stupid doing
 such tool for the others.

 It is written in Java and it has been tested only on Sun Java virtual
 machine version 1.5.


HOW TO RUN ?

 For simplicity, the program is already compiled (you may recompile it
 using the provided makefile). Just run 'giraffe.sh' and don't worry
 about the rest.
